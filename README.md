Pill dispenser script was created as a school project for a <b>RaspberryPi Pico</b> based pill dispenser. The goal was to create a pill dispenser that can calibrate itself to start position and dispense seven pills. 
After seventh pill the dispenser stops operating and requires re-calibration.

Imported classes and functions were provided by the course instructor and they are not included here. Therefore the script can't but executed as is.
