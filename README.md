Pill dispenser was a school project done on aÂ RaspberryPi Pico. 

The goal was to create an "automated" seven slot pill dispenser that could calibrate itself to start position and dispense pills one slot at a time. The dispenser had a piezo sensor that was used to detect if the slot was empty (no pill falling on sensor). After detecting seven hits the pill dispenser stoped operating and required re-calibration.

Imported classes and functions used in the project were provided by the course instructor and they are not included in the GitHub repo. Therefore the script can't but executed as is.
